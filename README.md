# Dungeon Explorer

### Description:
This is a basic game that I made for my final project in my college python course. It is a basic dungeon exploring game that is similar to Zork. It is fully text based but it does include map drawings using turtle. It was made using various loops and functions to keep simplicity and make the game run smoothly. I made a menu to keep things simple and help the player understand the various functions they can do. I used dictionaries for the rooms and items in the game so it could be easily accessed by the other functions and be updated from there.

### Features:
- Room drawings using turtle
- Text based game
- Multi Menu
- Monster Fight
- Various functions such as Searching for items and Movement
- Changing texts due to circumstances
